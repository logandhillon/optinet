# Optinet

Reinvented networking using **light.** ðŸ’¡

Optinet does not build on top of existing Internet infrastructure, and goes as far to completely reinvent the wheel. _(in a good way..?)_

It goes as far to completely recreate all OSI layers, from the physical to application layers.

## Documentation

The Optinet documentation is accessible at [logandhillon.github.io/optinet ðŸ”—](https://logandhillon.github.io/optinet/osi)

## Requirements

- As specified by OSI L1:
  - Input: camera or other light sensor.
  - Output: screen or other light emmitter.
  - Protocols that use the spectral sequencer must support colour on I/O layer 1.
